      Pollution, the introduction of harmful substances into our environment, is
      more than a global problem.<br />
      Although urban areas are usually more polluted than the countryside,
      pollution can spread to remote places where no people live. All living
      thingsâ€”from one-celled microbes to blue whalesâ€”depend on Earthâ€™s supply of
      air and water. When these resources are polluted, all forms of life are
      threatened.<br />
