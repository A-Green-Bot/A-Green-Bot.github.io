            Earth. Home to almost 8 billion people <br />
            Earth. A mother to us that protects us from evil <br />
            But we are the ones putting Earth into misery <br />
            When will our Earth, our mother, finally be free? <br />
            But we don’t have to be so mean, we can stop <br />
            Take out trash, water a seed, pick up a mop! <br />
            Our mothers like to be sustainable and clean <br />
            Earth is covered in trash, when will it be seen? <br />
            It all begins with simple steps, very easy to do <br />
            To get you started, I’ll give you a small clue <br />
            A tray of food and wrappers, separate them as you go <br />
            Put them in the proper bins, which might be slow <br />
            We introduce you to the one and only machinery <br />
            Separate your trash and help Earth with ease <br />
            No need to stress about it, we got you covered <br />
            Try it out, it has now been discovered
            <br />

  <center><h1>So, what's the problem?</h1>
    <p> Tons of trash, but nobody has the heart to help out. </p>
    <h1> How did we solve that? </h1>
    <p> We, GreenBot, have created an efficient machine that will allow users to learn the seperation of their trash successfully. </p>
    <h1>How long did it take?</h1>
    <p> It took at least 6 years to succesfully get up to this stage, but hey, we got it done! </p></center></center>
